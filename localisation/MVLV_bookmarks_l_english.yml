 1999_START_DESC:0 "In the year 1999, Mankind stands on the brink of destruction. In fighting the BETA for nearly 30 years now humanity has lost control of much of the total landmass of Earth, with almost the entire Eurasian Continent being lost. The Eastern advance of BETA, which began 9 years ago has now reached the Japanese archipelago, if the BETA cannot be prevented from consuming yet another great nation the destruction of mankind will be inevitable."
 JAP_1999_START_DESC:0 "Japan has lost much of her territory and people in the Great BETA invasion in 1998, through the sacrifice of many soldiers at the Emperors Absolute Defence line over several months many were able to evacuate from the encroaching BETA horde but the BETA have now pushed into the Kanto region and to worsen matters have reached Sado Island constructing a hive there. Though without the Intervention and support of US and UNAF forces, the day when the Imperial city of Tokyo will fall may be near and with it the loss of Japan as a whole."
 BET_1999_START_DESC:0 "BETA or Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of the human race. Are an alien life-form that is hostile to humanity. First spotted on Mars in 1958, they arrived on the Moon in 1967 and, after a brief conflict with humanity's space forces, invaded Earth in 1973. As of 1999 it has conquered 90% of the Eurasian Continent, threatening many remaining nations. Should this position of dominance on Earth remain without any form of counter offensive across the next few years little hope remains for the survival of Earth."
 USA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The United States is one of the few nations not to have been invaded by the BETA alongside being the only superpower of the same, and is the world's strongest country in 1999. It contributes to the war effort through large exports weapons and leases of its industrial power to other nations around the world, wielding an overwhelming total industrial power however the extent of its production capabilities is stifled due to lack of public support and apathetic nature in relation to the war. Should the true power of the US be unlocked the path to humanity’s victory may be opened."
 EUR_1999_START_DESC:0 "The European Union is a supranational union centred on the western countries of Europe, established in 1972 as a military alliance but later evolved into a federal system with the onslaught of the BETA to which by 1999 the continent of Europe is almost completely controlled by the BETA with the exception of the British Isles and Scilly. Following the majority loss of the continent the United Kingdom now serves as the headquarters for the EU at the forefront in the European theatre, having repulsed a major and crippling attempt to cross the English Channel the Union has reorganised with the aim of recapturing Europe."
 SOV_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Soviet Union was once a superpower that fought against the United States but lost the vast majority of its land to the BETA by 1999 clinging on to its far Siberian territory forming a defence line on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and provided territory in Alaska through a lease by the USA. However it still remains a strong military and industrial power considered second only to the US. The Soviet Communist government is eager to recapture lost territory and overthrow the dominance of the United States."
 UNI_1999_START_DESC:0 "United Nations Armed Forces was established by the Vancouver Agreement, which prohibits countries from fighting arbitrarily in the BETA War.Currently, it absorbs the troops of small countries destroyed by BETA to form a large army, but its influence on the world is low.If the United Nations gives great results, it may be possible to unite human beings who do not stop fighting."
 AFR_1999_START_DESC:0 "Africa, the birthplace of mankind, has reached a major turning point in its history after Europe was ravaged by the BETA, many nations exiled from the content have begun investing heavily in Africa, its former colonies. As a result of such investment in both industrial and infrastructure across Africa members of the Union have benefited from this having some of the largest cities in the world. The Union having focused its attention on the Suez Absolute Defence Line, now is the time to get rid of the BETA with African hands and put an end to every past wrong dealt to the people of Africa bythe Europeans."
 CHI_1999_START_DESC:0 "At the beginning of the BETA's invasion of earth, the People's Republic of China attempted to with aid from the Soviet Union repel it alone, but following the emergence of the laser class BETA the sole advantage humanity held was lost and the nation suffered a huge blow forcing the PRC, with its gradual loss of land, to establish with in Taiwan the Republic of China, a military and economic aid alliance in 1987, pooling their resources and forming the United Front of China. Though many question the UFC's strength with problems arising frequently due to differences between the two, what is assured is that Taiwan's defense will not continue without difficulty from the BETA, or from within."
 GEU_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Greater East Asia Union is a national alliance formed by the Far East countries except India and China, such as Korea and Indonesia, and Japan. Initially, these nations each joined the United Nations forces and continued fighting with BETA, but they lost their land, were highly motivated, and had no strong backing, they were preferentially sent to the forefront. In order to correct this, a plan to form a national alliance and join the United Nations forces emerged, and as a result, the Greater East Asia Union was formed. "
